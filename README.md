👋 Hey there

Welcome to my humble code vault — also known as “the place where I forget what I’ve already done and then come back to copy from myself”.

🛠️ Tech I use to pretend I know what I’m doing:

JavaScript (the espresso shot of coding ☕)

Python (because sometimes I like my code to feel smarter than me)

React (components everywhere, sanity optional)

📂 What you’ll probably find here:

Half-finished projects (is it a feature or a bug? …yes)

Things that only work on my machine

Random experiments inspired by StackOverflow at 2AM

🌱 About me

I write code, I break code, and sometimes I even fix code.

Refactoring? Only if procrastination counts as a design pattern.

If it works, don’t touch it. If it doesn’t work… also don’t touch it (blame the cache).
